<p>Passing the OSCP was a transformative experience. It required months of preparation, countless hours of practice, and unwavering determination. The exam challenged me not only technically but also mentally. Here are some takeaways from my journey:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Attempt:</strong> I didn’t pass on my first attempt, but this failure was a valuable learning experience. It taught me to refine my strategies, improve my time management, and focus more on areas where I was weak.</li>
<li>
<h4 id="second-attempt-and-success">Second Attempt and Success:<a href="#second-attempt-and-success" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After my initial failure, I re-evaluated my preparation approach. I focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengthening Weak Areas:</strong> I identified the topics and techniques where I struggled and dedicated extra time to mastering them.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Practice:</strong> I worked on additional machines on platforms like Hack The Box and PG Practice, ensuring I encountered diverse scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Time Management:</strong> I implemented a structured approach during the exam, allocating specific times for enumeration, exploitation, and documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency is Key:</strong> Regular practice and revisiting fundamental concepts helped me build a strong foundation.</li>
<li><strong>Lab Work:</strong> The PWK labs were invaluable for honing my skills and building confidence.</li>
<li><strong>HTB Academy:</strong> HTB Academy was an essential resource during my preparation. Its structured learning paths and practical exercises provided clarity on advanced topics and helped me approach challenges more methodically.</li>
<li><strong>UDP Scans:</strong> I learned the importance of performing UDP scans. Several services critical to exploitation were only accessible through UDP, highlighting the need for thorough scanning.</li>
<li><strong>Backup Plans:</strong> Having backup plans for tools and techniques proved invaluable. When one method failed, alternative tools or strategies ensured continued progress.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Maintaining detailed notes during preparation proved essential during the exam and for writing the final report.</li>
</ul>
<p>Achieving the OSCP has not only validated my technical skills but also opened new doors in my cybersecurity career. It’s more than just a certification, it’s a testament to perseverance and expertise. Achieving the OSCP was a moment of pride not just for me but for my family. My success surprised everyone, and I was showered with gifts and encouragement from my cousins, who were thrilled by my accomplishment.</p>
